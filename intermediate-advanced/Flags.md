# flags

## Objectives

> Solving an uncommon visual code in crytography

1. Begin by downloading and opening the .png image from the challenge
2. To decipher the hidden flag in the image, remember the format of picoCTF flags is always "picoCTF{XXXXXXXX}"
3. The image can be viewed at individual images representing individual characters of the flag. This can be deduced by there being seven symbols, representing 'picoCTF' followed by { } brackets 
4. To identify the code represented by each square of the image, you can perform a image search on google by cropping one of the squares and dragging it onto the google search bar
5. This should lead to results with a hyperlink referencing to these symbols being flags making up the [International Maritime Signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_maritime_signal_flags), from which the remaining flags can be decoded in the image
