# So Meta
## Objectives
> - Understand image metadata and how to view it.

Image files have a lot more information than they let on! There is a standard called **exif** (Exchangeable Image File format) that specifies the format for various types of image and sound files. Additionally, it also specifies a bunch of metadata tags that can be used in images to include more information such as artist, size and software. In our case, perhaps it could be used to hide the flag?

The difficult part of this challenge is knowing how to view the metadata of an image file. A commonly-used tool for this is exiftool, which gives us all the exif fields. The 'Artist' field has an interesting value, don't you think?
