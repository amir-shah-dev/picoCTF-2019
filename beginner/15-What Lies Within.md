# What Lies Within

## Objectives

>- Uncover a message hidden through Steganography 

1. Begin by downloading and opening the image file `buildings.png`. Upon first inspection, you will notice the flag is not clearly visible to us
2. The flag has actually been stored within the bits of the image, in a technique known as [Stenography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography). To retrieve the flag you will need an online steganography decoder
3. Using a [Steganography decoder](https://stylesuxx.github.io/steganography/) will provide us with the flag, which was hidden using [LSB encoding](https://wiki.bi0s.in/forensics/lsb/)
